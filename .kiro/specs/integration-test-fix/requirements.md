# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Integration Test Fix feature implements a comprehensive automated integration test system for the World Generation framework. This system validates that all world generation components work together correctly and identifies specific failures that need to be addressed. The integration test provides automated validation of system initialization, terrain generation consistency, persistence, biome integration, PCG content generation, POI placement, and performance validation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to run automated integration tests for the world generation system, so that I can quickly identify and fix system integration issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `wg.IntegrationTest` THEN the system SHALL execute a comprehensive test suite covering all world generation components
2. WHEN the integration test runs THEN the system SHALL test system initialization, terrain generation, persistence, biome integration, PCG content, POI placement, and performance
3. WHEN all tests pass THEN the system SHALL display "✓ ALL INTEGRATION TESTS PASSED" with a count of passed tests
4. WHEN any test fails THEN the system SHALL display "✗ SOME INTEGRATION TESTS FAILED" with specific failure details
5. IF the integration test encounters errors THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to validate system initialization, so that I can ensure all services start correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system initialization test runs THEN the system SHALL verify WorldGenSettings loads successfully
2. WHEN the system initialization test runs THEN the system SHALL verify all core services (Noise, Climate, Heightfield, Biome, PCG, POI) initialize without errors
3. WHEN the system initialization test runs THEN the system SHALL validate service dependencies are properly configured
4. IF any service fails to initialize THEN the system SHALL report the specific service and error details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to validate terrain generation consistency, so that I can ensure deterministic world generation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the terrain consistency test runs THEN the system SHALL generate the same tile multiple times with the same seed
2. WHEN comparing generated tiles THEN the system SHALL verify identical heightfield data and checksums
3. WHEN the terrain consistency test runs THEN the system SHALL validate seamless borders between adjacent tiles
4. IF terrain generation is inconsistent THEN the system SHALL report checksum mismatches and affected tile coordinates

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to validate terrain editing and persistence, so that I can ensure modifications are properly saved and restored.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the persistence test runs THEN the system SHALL perform terrain modifications using all 4 brush operations
2. WHEN terrain modifications are made THEN the system SHALL save the modifications to disk
3. WHEN the persistence test runs THEN the system SHALL reload the modified terrain and verify changes persist
4. WHEN terrain is modified THEN the system SHALL verify vegetation is properly cleared from edited areas
5. IF persistence fails THEN the system SHALL report specific file I/O errors and affected tile coordinates

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to validate biome system integration, so that I can ensure biomes are determined correctly based on climate data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the biome integration test runs THEN the system SHALL verify biome determination uses correct climate data
2. WHEN the biome integration test runs THEN the system SHALL validate biome transitions are smooth and consistent
3. WHEN the biome integration test runs THEN the system SHALL verify biome-specific content generation rules
4. IF biome integration fails THEN the system SHALL report climate calculation errors or biome assignment issues

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to validate PCG content generation, so that I can ensure vegetation and content spawn properly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the PCG integration test runs THEN the system SHALL verify PCG content generates deterministically
2. WHEN the PCG integration test runs THEN the system SHALL validate HISM instance management and performance
3. WHEN the PCG integration test runs THEN the system SHALL verify content spawns according to biome rules
4. WHEN the PCG integration test runs THEN the system SHALL test add/remove operations for dynamic content
5. IF PCG integration fails THEN the system SHALL report generation errors and performance issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to validate POI generation and placement, so that I can ensure points of interest are placed correctly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the POI integration test runs THEN the system SHALL verify POI placement uses stratified sampling
2. WHEN the POI integration test runs THEN the system SHALL validate POI placement respects slope and altitude constraints
3. WHEN the POI integration test runs THEN the system SHALL verify terrain stamping is applied correctly around POIs
4. WHEN the POI integration test runs THEN the system SHALL validate POI persistence and modification tracking
5. IF POI integration fails THEN the system SHALL report placement constraint violations and stamping errors

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to validate performance requirements, so that I can ensure the system meets target generation times.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the performance test runs THEN the system SHALL measure tile generation times and verify they meet target thresholds
2. WHEN the performance test runs THEN the system SHALL measure PCG generation times per tile
3. WHEN the performance test runs THEN the system SHALL validate memory usage stays within acceptable limits
4. WHEN the performance test runs THEN the system SHALL verify streaming performance meets frame rate targets
5. IF performance validation fails THEN the system SHALL report specific timing violations and performance bottlenecks

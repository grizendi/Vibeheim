# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The World Generation feature provides the foundational procedural world system for the Valheim-inspired prototype using UE5's native systems. This system creates a runtime heightfield-based world with multiple biomes, points of interest (POIs), and streaming content using PCG Framework, World Partition, and Virtual Heightfield Mesh. The world serves as the persistent environment where all other game systems will operate.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to explore a procedurally generated world, so that each playthrough offers unique terrain and discovery opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL generate a heightfield-based world using a configurable seed value
2. WHEN the same seed is used THEN the system SHALL generate identical world layouts for reproducible gameplay
3. WHEN a player moves through the world THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent terrain generation using World Partition streaming
4. IF the world generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide fallback generation options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experience different biomes with distinct characteristics, so that exploration feels varied and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the world generates THEN the system SHALL create 2-3 distinct biomes with unique visual and gameplay characteristics
2. WHEN a player enters a biome THEN the system SHALL apply biome-specific environmental properties using PCG rules
3. WHEN biomes transition THEN the system SHALL create smooth boundaries using Runtime Virtual Texturing
4. WHEN a biome is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure each biome has appropriate resource distribution via PCG spawning

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to discover points of interest and vegetation, so that exploration is rewarded with unique gameplay experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the world generates THEN the system SHALL place POIs using PCG Framework with embedded logic systems
2. WHEN vegetation spawns THEN the system SHALL use Instanced Static Mesh (HISM) for performance optimization
3. WHEN the world generates THEN the system SHALL create authored content areas (towns, dungeons) using World Partition
4. WHEN a player approaches authored areas THEN the system SHALL stream content automatically
5. WHEN PCG content spawns THEN the system SHALL support runtime add/remove operations for dynamic gameplay
6. IF POI placement conflicts with terrain THEN the system SHALL adjust placement using PCG collision rules

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage UE5's native world generation systems, so that the prototype integrates seamlessly with the engine's performance and streaming capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing world generation THEN the system SHALL utilize Virtual Heightfield Mesh (VHM) or Procedural Mesh for terrain rendering
2. WHEN the terrain system initializes THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate heightfield settings for gameplay performance
3. WHEN terrain renders THEN the system SHALL use Runtime Virtual Texturing for efficient terrain blending and foliage sampling
4. IF native UE5 systems encounter errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the world to load efficiently as I explore, so that gameplay remains smooth without long loading interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player moves through the world THEN the system SHALL stream terrain and content dynamically using World Partition
2. WHEN content loads THEN the system SHALL prioritize areas closest to the player for immediate loading
3. WHEN terrain is modified THEN the system SHALL preserve player modifications to the heightfield
4. WHEN the world streams THEN the system SHALL maintain target frame rates during content loading operations
5. IF content loading fails THEN the system SHALL retry loading and provide fallback content generation

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Enhanced World Generation feature transforms the existing voxel world system into a Valheim-inspired earth-like procedural world. This system creates visually distinct biomes with unique materials and colors, realistic geographical features using advanced noise algorithms, height-based biome distribution, vegetation systems for crafting, and configurable world boundaries. The enhanced system builds upon the existing VoxelPluginLegacy foundation while adding sophisticated terrain generation and biome diversity.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to explore a procedurally generated earth-like world with realistic geographical features, so that the terrain feels natural and immersive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the world generates THEN the system SHALL use advanced noise algorithms optimized for earth-like terrain with mountains, valleys, and rivers
2. WHEN terrain is generated THEN the system SHALL create realistic geographical features including mountain ranges, river systems, and coastal areas
3. WHEN the same seed is used THEN the system SHALL generate identical world layouts for reproducible gameplay
4. WHEN a player moves through the world THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent terrain generation at chunk boundaries
5. IF the world generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide fallback generation options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experience visually distinct biomes with unique materials and colors, so that each biome feels unique and recognizable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the world generates THEN the system SHALL create multiple distinct biomes each with their own material or color scheme
2. WHEN a player enters a biome THEN the system SHALL render terrain using biome-specific materials that clearly distinguish it from other biomes
3. WHEN biomes transition THEN the system SHALL create smooth material blending between different biome types
4. WHEN a biome is rendered THEN the system SHALL ensure visual consistency within the biome boundaries

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want biomes to contain vegetation information for future harvesting and crafting systems, so that each biome offers unique resources and gameplay opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a biome generates THEN the system SHALL define vegetation data including foliage types, tree species, and resource availability
2. WHEN biome vegetation is defined THEN the system SHALL specify harvestable resources appropriate for crafting progression
3. WHEN vegetation data is stored THEN the system SHALL make it accessible for future harvesting and crafting systems
4. WHEN different biomes are compared THEN the system SHALL ensure each biome has distinct vegetation profiles for gameplay variety

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want biomes to be distributed based on elevation, so that the world feels realistic with mountains at high elevations and water at low elevations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN terrain height exceeds a configurable mountain threshold THEN the system SHALL generate mountain biome with snow-like terrain characteristics
2. WHEN terrain height falls below a configurable water threshold THEN the system SHALL generate ocean/water biome
3. WHEN elevation-based biomes are applied THEN the system SHALL override other biome types in extreme elevation areas
4. WHEN height thresholds are configured THEN the system SHALL allow designers to adjust mountain and water elevation boundaries

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a game designer, I want to configure world size, shape, biome count, and content without playing in the editor, so that I can efficiently test different world configurations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring the world THEN the system SHALL provide settings for world size limits without requiring editor play mode
2. WHEN world parameters are set THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of world shape (circular, square, etc.)
3. WHEN biome settings are configured THEN the system SHALL allow specification of biome count and their content parameters
4. WHEN world generation runs THEN the system SHALL respect all configured boundaries and parameters
5. WHEN using construction scripts THEN the system SHALL integrate properly with VoxelPlugin tools for immediate world preview

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experience a planet-like world where reaching the edge shows the other side, so that the world feels like a complete sphere rather than a flat map.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player reaches the world boundary THEN the system SHALL provide visual indication of the world continuing on the other side
2. WHEN world wrapping is implemented THEN the system SHALL create seamless transitions at world edges
3. WHEN the world edge is approached THEN the system SHALL maintain terrain consistency across the boundary
4. IF world wrapping is enabled THEN the system SHALL ensure all game systems (biomes, POIs, etc.) work correctly across boundaries

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage the existing VoxelPluginLegacy system, so that world generation integrates seamlessly with the project's voxel infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing world generation THEN the system SHALL utilize the VoxelPluginLegacy located at Plugins/VoxelPluginLegacy
2. WHEN the voxel system initializes THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate voxel world settings for gameplay performance
3. WHEN voxel chunks load THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage and rendering performance
4. IF the VoxelPluginLegacy encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a player, I want the world to load efficiently as I explore, so that gameplay remains smooth without long loading interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player moves through the world THEN the system SHALL stream terrain chunks dynamically based on player position
2. WHEN chunks are loaded THEN the system SHALL prioritize chunks closest to the player for immediate loading
3. WHEN chunks are unloaded THEN the system SHALL preserve any player modifications to the terrain
4. WHEN the world streams THEN the system SHALL maintain target frame rates during chunk loading operations
5. IF chunk loading fails THEN the system SHALL retry loading and provide fallback terrain generation

# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The World Generation feature provides the foundational procedural world system for the Valheim-inspired prototype. This system creates a voxel-based, seed-driven world with multiple biomes, points of interest (POIs), and dungeon portals. The world serves as the persistent environment where all other game systems will operate, utilizing the existing VoxelPluginLegacy for terrain generation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to explore a procedurally generated world, so that each playthrough offers unique terrain and discovery opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the game starts THEN the system SHALL generate a voxel-based world using a configurable seed value
2. WHEN the same seed is used THEN the system SHALL generate identical world layouts for reproducible gameplay
3. WHEN a player moves through the world THEN the system SHALL maintain consistent terrain generation at chunk boundaries
4. IF the world generation fails THEN the system SHALL display an error message and provide fallback generation options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to experience different biomes with distinct characteristics, so that exploration feels varied and meaningful.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the world generates THEN the system SHALL create 2-3 distinct biomes with unique visual and gameplay characteristics
2. WHEN a player enters a biome THEN the system SHALL apply biome-specific environmental properties (terrain type, vegetation, resources)
3. WHEN biomes transition THEN the system SHALL create smooth boundaries between different biome types
4. WHEN a biome is generated THEN the system SHALL ensure each biome has appropriate resource distribution for gameplay progression

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player, I want to discover points of interest and dungeons, so that exploration is rewarded with unique gameplay experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the world generates THEN the system SHALL place POIs as pre-made voxel structures with embedded logic systems
2. WHEN a POI is placed THEN the system SHALL ensure it integrates properly with the surrounding terrain
3. WHEN the world generates THEN the system SHALL create dungeon portals that serve as entry points to instanced dungeon areas
4. WHEN a player interacts with a dungeon portal THEN the system SHALL transport them to a pre-built dungeon instance
5. WHEN dungeons are instanced THEN the system SHALL maintain separate world states for each dungeon instance
6. IF POI or dungeon placement conflicts with terrain THEN the system SHALL adjust placement to maintain structural integrity

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to leverage the existing VoxelPluginLegacy system, so that world generation integrates seamlessly with the project's voxel infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing world generation THEN the system SHALL utilize the VoxelPluginLegacy located at Plugins/VoxelPluginLegacy
2. WHEN the voxel system initializes THEN the system SHALL configure appropriate voxel world settings for gameplay performance
3. WHEN voxel chunks load THEN the system SHALL optimize memory usage and rendering performance
4. IF the VoxelPluginLegacy encounters errors THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information for debugging

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the world to load efficiently as I explore, so that gameplay remains smooth without long loading interruptions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player moves through the world THEN the system SHALL stream terrain chunks dynamically based on player position
2. WHEN chunks are loaded THEN the system SHALL prioritize chunks closest to the player for immediate loading
3. WHEN chunks are unloaded THEN the system SHALL preserve any player modifications to the terrain
4. WHEN the world streams THEN the system SHALL maintain target frame rates during chunk loading operations
5. IF chunk loading fails THEN the system SHALL retry loading and provide fallback terrain generation

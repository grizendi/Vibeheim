# Vibeheim WorldGen ‚Äî MVP (Valheim feel, minimal)

Goal: Big outdoor world with ring-biased biomes, fast tile streaming, PCG trees/rocks, a few POIs, and three terrain brushes that persist. Single-player only.

Out of Scope (Phase 2): Networking/replication, World Partition tuning, RVT/decals, undo/redo, fancy POI retries, compression/CRC, dynamic navmesh.

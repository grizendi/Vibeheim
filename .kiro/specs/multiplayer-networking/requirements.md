# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Multiplayer Networking Foundation provides the core networking architecture for the Valheim-inspired prototype. This system establishes a minimal but robust multiplayer framework that enables deterministic world synchronization, server-authoritative voxel editing, and efficient state replication without transmitting heavy mesh data. The foundation integrates with the existing world generation system to ensure all clients maintain identical procedural worlds while only replicating inputs and state changes.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to join multiplayer sessions with other players, so that we can explore and build in the same persistent world together.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a host starts a multiplayer session THEN the system SHALL create a Listen Server for development purposes
2. WHEN a client joins a session THEN the system SHALL replicate the world seed and generation parameters to ensure identical terrain
3. WHEN multiple players are in the same world THEN the system SHALL maintain deterministic world state across all clients
4. WHEN a player joins late THEN the system SHALL synchronize their world state with existing modifications
5. IF network connection fails THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and reconnection options

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want my voxel edits to be synchronized with other players, so that our collaborative building efforts are persistent and visible to everyone.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a player performs a voxel edit THEN the system SHALL validate the edit on the server before applying
2. WHEN the server validates an edit THEN the system SHALL apply it locally, persist the change, and replicate to all relevant clients
3. WHEN clients receive edit operations THEN the system SHALL apply the same operation locally and remesh affected chunks
4. WHEN edit operations are replicated THEN the system SHALL only transmit operation data, not mesh geometry
5. WHEN a player exceeds edit rate limits THEN the system SHALL reject excessive operations to prevent griefing
6. IF an edit operation fails validation THEN the system SHALL log the failure and notify the requesting client

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a player joining an existing session, I want to see all previous modifications to the world, so that I experience the same world state as other players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a client completes world generation THEN the system SHALL request synchronization data for visible chunks
2. WHEN the server receives sync requests THEN the system SHALL send only edit operations newer than the client's current state
3. WHEN clients receive sync operations THEN the system SHALL apply them in chronological order to rebuild the current world state
4. WHEN chunk synchronization completes THEN the system SHALL ensure the client's world matches the server's authoritative state
5. IF synchronization fails for any chunk THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff and provide fallback options

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a player, I want the game world to have consistent time and weather across all clients, so that environmental conditions are synchronized for all players.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the server updates world time THEN the system SHALL replicate the time state to all connected clients
2. WHEN weather conditions change THEN the system SHALL replicate weather state parameters to maintain visual consistency
3. WHEN clients receive time/weather updates THEN the system SHALL smoothly interpolate to the new state for visual continuity
4. WHEN a client joins mid-session THEN the system SHALL immediately synchronize current time and weather state
5. IF time/weather replication fails THEN the system SHALL use local fallback values and attempt re-synchronization

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the networking system to maintain deterministic world generation, so that all clients produce identical terrain without transmitting mesh data.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN world generation occurs THEN the system SHALL use identical seeds, version numbers, and plugin hashes across all clients
2. WHEN procedural content is generated THEN the system SHALL derive all randomness from deterministic seed-based functions
3. WHEN clients generate chunks THEN the system SHALL produce identical results given the same input parameters
4. WHEN the system detects determinism violations THEN the system SHALL log detailed information for debugging
5. IF determinism cannot be maintained THEN the system SHALL provide fallback synchronization mechanisms

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a player, I want Points of Interest and interactive objects to be synchronized across all clients, so that discoveries and interactions are shared experiences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN POIs are generated THEN the system SHALL spawn them as replicated actors on the server
2. WHEN players interact with POIs THEN the system SHALL replicate interaction results to all relevant clients
3. WHEN dynamic objects are created THEN the system SHALL use standard Unreal Engine replication for non-voxel entities
4. WHEN POI states change THEN the system SHALL maintain consistency across all connected clients
5. IF POI replication fails THEN the system SHALL attempt recovery and log synchronization issues

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want efficient network bandwidth usage, so that the multiplayer experience remains smooth even with limited network resources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN determining network relevancy THEN the system SHALL only replicate data to clients within appropriate distance ranges
2. WHEN managing network traffic THEN the system SHALL prioritize critical updates over less important state changes
3. WHEN clients are outside interaction range THEN the system SHALL reduce or eliminate non-essential replication
4. WHEN network congestion occurs THEN the system SHALL implement appropriate throttling and prioritization
5. IF bandwidth becomes critically limited THEN the system SHALL gracefully degrade non-essential features while maintaining core functionality

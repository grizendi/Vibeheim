# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Integration Test Crash Fix addresses a critical null pointer dereference crash in the World Generation integration test system. The crash occurs in `UTileStreamingService::GenerateSingleTile()` at line 274 when the integration test attempts to run performance validation. The root cause is missing service initialization code in the `UWorldGenIntegrationTest` class, where the `Initialize()`, `CreateServiceInstances()`, and `InitializeServices()` methods are declared in the header but not implemented in the source file.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to properly initialize all world generation services, so that the test can run without crashing due to null pointer dereferences.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the integration test starts THEN the system SHALL implement the missing `Initialize()` method to set up the test environment
2. WHEN service initialization occurs THEN the system SHALL implement `CreateServiceInstances()` to create all required service objects
3. WHEN services are created THEN the system SHALL implement `InitializeServices()` to properly configure service dependencies
4. WHEN the TileStreamingService is used THEN the system SHALL ensure HeightfieldService, BiomeService, and PCGWorldService are properly initialized
5. IF service initialization fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error messages indicating which service failed and why

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to validate the test environment before running tests, so that I can catch initialization issues early.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the test environment validation runs THEN the system SHALL implement `ValidateTestEnvironment()` to check all services are properly initialized
2. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify all service pointers are non-null and properly configured
3. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL check that temporary directories can be created and accessed
4. WHEN validation occurs THEN the system SHALL verify WorldGenSettings are loaded and valid
5. IF validation fails THEN the system SHALL prevent test execution and report specific validation failures

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want proper cleanup and error handling in the integration test, so that failed tests don't leave the system in an inconsistent state.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests complete THEN the system SHALL implement proper cleanup methods to release service instances
2. WHEN tests fail THEN the system SHALL implement `HandleTestFailure()` to log detailed error information
3. WHEN cleanup occurs THEN the system SHALL implement `RestoreSystemState()` to reset any modified system state
4. WHEN temporary data is created THEN the system SHALL implement proper directory creation and removal methods
5. IF cleanup fails THEN the system SHALL log warnings but not prevent the test from completing

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test to use proper WorldGen configuration, so that tests run with realistic and consistent settings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are initialized THEN the system SHALL load WorldGenSettings from the standard configuration file
2. WHEN test configuration is applied THEN the system SHALL use the test seed and parameters from FTestConfiguration
3. WHEN services are configured THEN the system SHALL ensure all services use consistent configuration data
4. WHEN configuration loading fails THEN the system SHALL fall back to default test configuration values
5. IF configuration is invalid THEN the system SHALL report specific validation errors and use safe defaults

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the integration test crash to be fixed immediately, so that I can run the test suite to validate the world generation system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I run `wg.IntegrationTest` THEN the system SHALL execute without crashing due to null pointer dereferences
2. WHEN the performance test runs THEN the system SHALL successfully call TileStreamingService methods without access violations
3. WHEN all tests complete THEN the system SHALL display proper test results with pass/fail status
4. WHEN the integration test finishes THEN the system SHALL properly clean up all resources and temporary data
5. IF any test fails THEN the system SHALL provide actionable error messages for debugging the specific failure

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UTileStreamingService to have defensive programming guards, so that future initialization mistakes fail fast with clear error messages instead of crashes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UTileStreamingService methods are called without proper initialization THEN the system SHALL use `ensureMsgf` guards to detect uninitialized state
2. WHEN `GenerateSingleTile()` is called THEN the system SHALL verify all required services (HeightfieldService, BiomeService, PCGService) are non-null before proceeding
3. WHEN `GetTileData()` is called THEN the system SHALL verify WorldGenSettings are properly loaded before accessing configuration
4. WHEN initialization validation fails THEN the system SHALL log clear error messages indicating which service dependency is missing
5. IF defensive checks fail THEN the system SHALL fail fast with descriptive error messages rather than allowing null pointer dereferences

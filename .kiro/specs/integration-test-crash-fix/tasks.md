# Implementation Plan

- [x] 1. Implement core initialization infrastructure





  - Add `Initialize()` method implementation in WorldGenIntegrationTest.cpp
  - Create `CreateTempDirectory()` and `RemoveTempDirectory()` helper methods
  - Implement `GetTempDataPath()` and `EnsureDirectoryExists()` utility methods
  - Add basic error logging and status tracking for initialization
  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.4_

- [x] 2. Implement service instance creation





  - Add `CreateServiceInstances()` method to create all required UObject service instances
  - Use proper `NewObject<T>()` calls for each service type
  - Implement null pointer validation for each created service
  - Add detailed error logging for service creation failures
  - _Requirements: 1.2, 2.2_

- [x] 3. Implement service initialization and dependency resolution





  - Add `InitializeServices()` method with proper dependency order
  - Initialize WorldGenSettings first, then services in dependency order
  - Configure service cross-references (TileStreamingService dependencies)
  - Add initialization timing and error tracking for each service
  - _Requirements: 1.3, 1.4, 4.1, 4.3_

- [x] 4. Implement test environment validation



  - Add `ValidateTestEnvironment()` method to check all services are properly initialized
  - Verify all service pointers are non-null and configured
  - Check temporary directory access and file system permissions
  - Validate WorldGenSettings loading and configuration consistency
  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_

- [x] 5. Implement cleanup and error handling methods





  - Add `CleanupServiceInstances()` method to properly release service objects
  - Implement `HandleTestFailure()` for detailed error reporting and logging
  - Add `RestoreSystemState()` to reset any modified system state
  - Create proper resource cleanup even when initialization fails
  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.5_

- [x] 6. Add defensive programming guards to UTileStreamingService





  - Add `ensureMsgf` guards in `GenerateSingleTile()` to check all required services are non-null
  - Add `ensureMsgf` guards in `GetTileData()` to verify WorldGenSettings are loaded
  - Implement proper null pointer checks with early return and error logging
  - Add descriptive error messages indicating which service dependency is missing
  - _Requirements: 6.1, 6.2, 6.3, 6.4, 6.5_

- [x] 7. Test and validate the crash fix






  - Run `wg.IntegrationTest` to verify the crash is resolved
  - Test each individual test category to ensure proper service usage
  - Validate that all services are properly initialized before use
  - Verify proper cleanup and resource management after test completion
  - Test defensive guards by attempting to use uninitialized services
  - _Requirements: 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, 5.5, 6.5_
